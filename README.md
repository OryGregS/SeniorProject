##### Probabilistic data-matching &amp; de-duplication
##### Gregory Smith | Axel Solano

## Summary
Our goal is to devise a probabilistic (*fuzzy*) data-matching algorithm to be used in a client data platform. This platform acts as a central hub for data from multiple sources. This algorithm will generate functionality to evaluate various field values between a master record, and a record to be matched. A metric of confidence of a match will be returned to the master record indicating potential matches.
