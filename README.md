# Senior Project

##### Fuzzy Record Linkage
##### Gregory Smith | Axel Solano

## Summary
Our goal is to devise a probabilistic (*fuzzy*) data-matching algorithm to be used in a client data platform. This platform acts as a central hub for data from multiple sources. This algorithm will generate functionality to evaluate various field values between a master record, and a record to be matched. A metric of confidence of a match will be returned to the master record indicating potential matches.

## Note
This program is not suitable for general data matching purposes. This was designed for a use-case specific to our client. However, the underlying methods of matching (similarity calculation & indexing method) are useful for general purposes.
